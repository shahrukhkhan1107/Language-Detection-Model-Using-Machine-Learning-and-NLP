Language Detection Using Machine Learning and NLP 

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on—a Language Detection Model using Multinomial Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer to detect languages across a diverse set of global languages!

-- Overview: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning approach, the model can accurately detect text written in the following languages:
Estonian, Swedish, Thai, Tamil, Dutch, Japanese
Turkish, Latin, Urdu, Indonesian, Portuguese, French
Chinese, Korean, Hindi, Spanish, Pushto, Persian
Romanian, Russian, English, Arabic.

-- Model Details:
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Chosen for its effectiveness in text classification tasks, especially when working with large and diverse datasets.
CountVectorizer: Converts the text into numerical features, focusing on token frequency to make the model learn language patterns effectively.

-- Key Learnings:
Language detection is a challenging yet exciting task given the similarities across some language families.
Preprocessing and feature engineering (tokenization, vectorization) play a critical role in the model's accuracy.
This model can be a stepping stone for applications in machine translation, sentiment analysis, and multilingual text processing.

-- Why it matters: In a globally connected world, language detection is crucial for various industries, from social media analysis to customer support. It’s fascinating to see how machine learning can break language barriers and drive innovation!
